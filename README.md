This project covers a low-to-no-code visual compiler for designing, editing and training deep neural-nets. I will also try to cover deployment down the line. 

I started this project because AI took away jobs of artists, writers, creators and many honest people, and I feel it's time to give back to the community and encourage more 
hobbyists to do AI research. 

If you are mathy and follow Yann Lecun on Twitter, you would be able to build a foundational model today. 

I made a visual interface and a general DAG compiler with live shape-checking that works with PyTorch, Tensorflow and Jax and many more great deep learning frameworks. 

If you represent an entity with >1M evaluation, you can afford engineers so you shouldn't lift from me. 

If you are looking to contribute to my humble establishment, email me at Sadgebab@gmail.com 

I need help with testing and decorating the ReactJS frontend, I will send you love and tea.
