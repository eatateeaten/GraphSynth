This project covers a low-to-no-code visual compiler for designing, editing and training deep neural-networks. 

I started this project because I got a lot of spite for ML engineers. They took away jobs of artists, writers, creators and many more honest people. 

If you are mathy and follow Yann Lecun on Twitter, you should be able to build a foundational model today, without the help of these overpaid people. 

You simply biong the architecture together, biong in some data streams, and biong!!!! it trains. and biong!! it runs inferences 

It's just a Biong Biong
