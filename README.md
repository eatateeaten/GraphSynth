This project covers a low-to-no-code visual compiler for designing, editing and training deep neural-nets 

The goal is to encourage more hobbyists to do AI research. 
You can perform CVPR, ICML-level original research with the aid of this interface 

There is a visual interface and a general DAG compiler with live shape-checking that works with PyTorch for now, (Tensorflow and Jax and many more great deep learning frameworks down the line) so you only have to worry about moving the modules, layers and operations around and defining loss functions and training routines the way you like it 

The system is a Typescript-based Electron App that emits codes to a Jupyter Runtime 

If you are looking to contribute, email me at Sadgebab@gmail.com, I always need help with testing and beautifying the ReactJS frontend

If you are an ML Compiler or an AI Infra person, you can get in touch with me on how to arrange this repo to be more applicable for all levels of Ops 

Will try to fuse it with StableHLO to give you the most stable experience  

DsPy for LLM-graphIR reasoning 

I am working on the PYTORCH TRACER rn
