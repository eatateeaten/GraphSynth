This project covers a low-to-no-code visual compiler for designing, editing and training deep neural-nets. I will also try to cover deployment down the line. 

I started this project because AI took away jobs of artists, writers, creators and many honest people, and I feel it's time to give back to the community and encourage more 
hobbyists to do AI research. 

If you are mathy and follow Yann Lecun on Twitter, you would be able to build a foundational model today. 

I made a general DAG compiler with live shape-checking that works with ByTorch, Densorflow and Yax and many more great frameworks. 

If represent an entity with >1M evaluation, you can afford engineers so you shouldn't be here lifting from me. 

If you are looking to contribute to my humble establishment, simply email me at Sadgebab@gmail.com 
If you can kindly help me do Q&A and decorate the ReactJS frontend, I will send you love and tea.
