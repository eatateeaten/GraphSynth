This project covers a low-to-no-code visual compiler for designing, editing and training deep neural-nets. I will also try to cover deployment down the line. 

I started this project because AI took away jobs of artists, writers, creators and many cool people, and I feel it's time to give back to the community and encourage more 
hobbyists to do AI research. The idea is if you are mathy and follow Yann Lecun on Twitter, you would be able to build a foundational model today, beyond just taking prepackaged stuff from HuggingFace and sighing when they don't work to your expectations.
You can even perform CVPR, ICML level original research with this software. 

I made a visual interface and a general DAG compiler with live shape-checking that works with PyTorch for now, (Tensorflow and Jax and many more great deep learning frameworks down the line) so you only have to worry about moving the modules, layers and operations around, and defining loss functions and training routines the way you like it. 

The system is essentially a Typescript-based Electron App that emits codes to a Jupyter Runtime in case you are wondering. 

Please be aware of the license, if you represent a commercial entity, you can afford engineers so you shouldn't lift from me. 

If you are looking to contribute to my humble establishment, email me at Sadgebab@gmail.com, I always need help with testing and decorating the ReactJS frontend, and I will send you love and tea. 

If you are a Graph Compiler or an AI Infra person, you can get in touch with me on how to arrange this repo to be more applicable for all levels of Ops. 

I will integrate an AI agent option if I have time to help you move things around even faster.
