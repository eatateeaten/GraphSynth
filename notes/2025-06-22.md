Sounds like a pragmatic move. Here‚Äôs a roadmap for keeping your visual compiler tightly-coupled to the PyTorch ecosystem while still leaving room for StableHLO / MLIR back-ends.

1‚ÄÇCapture: stay upstream-native

What to capture	PyTorch hook that gives you it	Why it‚Äôs perfect for a visual front end
Eager modules & scripted helpers	torch.fx.symbolic_trace (fast, minimal requirements)	Gives you nested call_module nodes with fully-qualified names‚Äîeasy to map back onto boxes in a GUI.
Dynamic shapes / data-dependent branches	torch._dynamo.export (2.1+) or torch.export (2.2+)	Emits a shape-safe FX graph with Guards + functional ops; you won‚Äôt lose branches taken on other inputs.
Gradients for training views	functorch.compile.aot_function (AOT Autograd)	Hand-built forward & backward FX graphs‚Äîno need to derive adjoints later.
Tensor-only kernels for inference	torch.compile(..., backend="inductor")	Inductor‚Äôs intermediate ATen graph can be inspected, then resurfaced as SSA if you want to show ‚Äúpost-fusion‚Äù view.
Tip: build a pluggable capture fa√ßade (pyt_capture(mode="fx"|"export"|"aot")) so advanced users can swap in a richer graph without touching the GUI code.
2‚ÄÇIntermediate representation: map FX ‚Üí Your IR

Node mapping
call_module ‚Üí OpNode tagged with qual_name (e.g. block.bn) + param handles
call_function / call_method ‚Üí PrimitiveNode (e.g. torch.relu)
get_attr ‚Üí ConstantParamNode (weights/buffers)
Edge mapping
FX edges are positional. Store them explicitly so the visual editor can re-lay out wires when users drag blocks around.
SSA re-write
Run a pass that renames outputs %tmp0 ‚Ä¶ so that every tensor gets a stable ID‚Äîthis keeps the TypeScript side deterministic even after a user shuffles nodes.
Metadata you‚Äôll be glad you kept
{
  "path": "block.bn",      // for breadcrumbs
  "dtype": "f32",
  "shape": [N, C, H, W],
  "requires_grad": true,
  "fx_node_idx": 42
}
3‚ÄÇTransform passes (visual + CLI)

Pass	Why users care	PyTorch helper
Functionalization / alias clean-up	Makes in-place ops explicit‚Äîeasier to reason about graph purity.	torch._functorch._functionalize
Constant folding & CSE	Users instantly see dead-weight nodes disappear.	torch.fx.passes.shape_prop, torch.fx.passes.fold_constants
Operator fusion preview	Show the groups Inductor will fuse (nice colour overlay).	torch._inductor.fx_utils.extract_graph_fusion_groups
StableHLO legalisation	Let users target IREE / TPU.	torch_xla.experimental.exported_program_to_stablehlo after your edits
Because your IR retains the fx_node_idx, you can bounce back and forth: do a transformation in Python, sync the patch into the TypeScript canvas, and vice-versa.

4‚ÄÇRound-tripping back to executable PyTorch

IR ‚Üí FX: serialise your edited graph as a list of node records; rebuild an fx.Graph in Python.
Re-attach the original sub-modules with gm.add_submodule(path, mod).
FX ‚Üí TorchScript / Inductor: just call torch.export on the reconstructed GraphModule.
Optional: hand the FX graph to torch-mlir if you want MLIR but not StableHLO.
This keeps your compiler source-compatible with future PyTorch releases; even if Inductor‚Äôs internals change, FX graphs stay stable.
5‚ÄÇWhy PyTorch is a sweet spot for a visual compiler

Massive op coverage: the functional ATen ops touched by FX already map 1-to-1 to high-level math blocks‚Äîno need for custom icons.
Stable procedural API: FX and Dynamo are public and under backward-compat guarantees.
Ecosystem gravity: diffusers, TorchVision, Lightning, etc., all output modules you can trace unchanged.
Inter-IR bridges: torch-xla ‚Üí StableHLO, torch-mlir ‚Üí MHLO, ONNX exporters‚Äîyour back-end menu grows ‚Äúfor free.‚Äù
6‚ÄÇShort sprint plan

Week	Deliverable
1	Minimal FX importer ‚Üí draw graph in canvas with nested groups.
2	SSA renamer + constant-shape annotator pass.
3	GUI action: ‚Äúinline selected Module‚Äù (expand a sub-graph) and ‚Äúfold constants‚Äù.
4	Export path: edited IR ‚Üí FX ‚Üí torch.export ‚Üí StableHLO file.
5	Proof-of-concept fuse-preview overlay using Inductor‚Äôs fusion sets.
You‚Äôll have a demo where a user drags a ResNet on-screen, collapses blocks, folds constants, and hits ‚ÄúExport to StableHLO‚Äù‚Äîall inside one month of focused hacking.

Bottom line
Anchoring the front end on PyTorch FX + Dynamo gives you:

Deep, recoverable nesting for an intuitive visual hierarchy.
Ready-made passes you can expose as one-click refactors.
Easy egress to StableHLO, ONNX, or TorchScript without re-implementing export logic.
When you start wiring the canvas to Python, let me know‚ÄîI can help craft the exact JSON schema for node-edge dumps or show how to splice Inductor‚Äôs fusion annotations into your TypeScript renderer. üöÄ

Why JAX+STABLEHLO is actually not that great to build on top of?  

I hear you ‚Äî both JAX and StableHLO come with real friction points. Below is a quick ‚Äúwarts-and-all‚Äù rundown of the biggest complaints I see in practice, plus a few pragmatic ways teams dodge them or switch stacks.

1‚ÄÇCommon pain points

Theme	Why it stings in day-to-day work
Purity discipline (JAX)	Every bit of mutable state (RNG keys, batch-norm stats, opt-state) has to be threaded through functions. Easy to get wrong, tedious in large models.
Shape rigidity	JAX‚Äôs shape-polymorphism flags help, but anything outside simple ‚Äúbatch-dim is dynamic‚Äù still triggers recompiles. StableHLO inherits that stiffness.
Debug ergonomics	After jit, you‚Äôre staring at HLO dumps. jax.debug.print helps, yet stepping through eager PyTorch is still smoother.
Op-set gaps (StableHLO)	Approx. 90 % of day-to-day ops are there, but new PyTorch/TF kernels show up months later‚Äîso you end up with custom_calls or fall back to MHLO/ATen.
Ecosystem gravity	Hugging Face, diffusers, most vision repos: PyTorch first, JAX sometimes, StableHLO rarely. Integrating third-party code means porting.
Toolchain churn	StableHLO ‚Üí IREE/PJRT build flags change quickly; yesterday‚Äôs CI script can break after a version bump.
2‚ÄÇMitigation tactics (if you must stay)

Irritant	Practical band-aid
Purity overhead	Use Flax Structs or Equinox so ‚Äústate threading‚Äù is automatic; PRNG keys live next to parameters.
Debugging	Insert jax.enable_x64() + tiny batch sizes locally; run under XLA_FLAGS=--xla_dump_hlo_snapshots to snapshot only post-fusion graphs.
Missing ops	Treat stablehlo.custom_call as a first-class escape hatch: compile everything else through IREE, then invoke the custom CUDA kernel via the plugin API.
Version churn	Pin StableHLO submodules to a commit hash and vendor the MLIR pass pipeline; upgrade on green CI only.
3‚ÄÇWhen teams just flip to something else

Need	Switch that usually fixes it
Prototypes with heavy I/O, dynamic control flow	PyTorch 2.x + torch.compile (Dynamo + Inductor). You keep eager feel, still get fused Triton kernels.
Cross-framework model zoo, ONNX export	PyTorch ‚Üí ONNX ‚Üí TensorRT/TensorFlow RT; debugging remains in eager PyTorch.
Multi-node TPU/GKE training without TPUs-only lock-in	PyTorch XLA (gives you TPU while writing PyTorch).
Tightest GPU kernels, hand-tuned	Triton or raw CUDA inside PyTorch custom ops.
Very large graphs + long-running inference service	TensorRT-LLM or ONNX Runtime with in-place quantisation; avoids StableHLO middle step entirely.
4‚ÄÇDecision cheatsheet

If your priority is‚Ä¶	Consider‚Ä¶
Maximum model zoo compatibility, easiest hiring	PyTorch stack end-to-end
Compositional autodiff tricks, clean multi-device SPMD	Stick with JAX but wrap in Flax/Equinox
‚ÄúCompile-once, deploy anywhere‚Äù (edge, mobile, server)	StableHLO/IREE is hard to beat‚Äîjust budget time for missing ops
Ultimate perf on NVIDIA GPUs without purity hassle	PyTorch 2.x + Triton custom kernels
Parting thought
A lot of folks end up hybrid:

Author & debug in PyTorch.
Export with torch.export ‚Üí StableHLO only for the production inference path.
Keep JAX around just for fast research prototypes where composable vmap/jit/grad magic really shines.
That mix gets you the broad ecosystem plus the deploy-anywhere IR without betting the whole org on one runtime.

If you‚Äôre leaning toward such a hybrid or still wrestling with a specific blocker (e.g., a missing StableHLO op or Dynamo trace break), let me know and we can drill into concrete code-level fixes.




IMPORTANT!!!
Each Op Class gotta have InferOutShape, ValidateInShape, EmitPyTorchModule
All three functions exist in Op classes and have corresponding helper functions in ModuleDB for each ModuleName 

Module has ValidateInShape and InferOutShape only when it's frozen 
When it's frozen a Module can technically go into the ModuleDB (We still need to figure this part out) 

Dynamic assignment of modules to the "NodeType" (OpClassHierarchy)

Gotta make the helper functions in ModuleDB too in a way so that changing the Op class hierarchy doesn't just break everything.
