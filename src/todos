in_dim out_dim have to be renamed 
users can either build it left to right with in_shape inference for the next node 

once it's done if they break the sequence auto shape inference is off

BatchNorm, and Dropout definitions too 
4. Make the compute graph creation consistent with PyTorch, TF, and ONNX 

5. NN.sequential 
6. torch.concat 

Look into 
7. torch.flatten 
8. torch.reshape 
11. torch.view 
12. torch.expand 
13. torch.expand_as 
14. torch.repeat 
15. torch.repeat_interleave 
16. torch.repeat_interleave
